Deception Lab

This project is a practical exploration of deception technologies used in cybersecurity. It includes full installation, configuration, and testing procedures for:

Dionaea (malware collection honeypot)

Cowrie (SSH/telnet honeypot)

OpenCanary (multi-protocol honeypot)

CanaryTokens (honeytokens via canarytokens.org)

📁 Project Structure

Each tool has its own folder with:

setup.md — how to install and deploy

configuration.md — customizing the honeypot

testing.md — simulated attacks and observed logs

🎯 Goal

The goal of this project is to simulate attacks and collect data that help improve detection and response capabilities. This project is part of my portfolio as a cybersecurity analyst.

🛠 Technologies Used

Ubuntu Server 20.04

Kali Linux (as attacker)

Docker (for Cowrie)

Python Virtualenv

Nmap, Hydra, Curl, SMB tools
